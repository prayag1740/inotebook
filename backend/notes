Promises in JavaScript

1) A JS promise contains both the producing code and calls the consuming code.
Callback can either be success or failure

A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” together. In terms of our analogy: this is the “subscription list”. The “producing code” takes whatever time it needs to produce the promised result, and the “promise” makes that result available to all of the subscribed code when it’s ready.


2)JS promise can be either pending, fulfilled or rejected

Async and await in JavaScript

1) async makes a function that returns a promise
 await makes a function wait for the promise
